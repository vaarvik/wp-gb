 * This sheet contains:
 * * All the SASS files that is inside the scss folder
 *
 * The file/folder structure follows the basic guidelines of SMACSS. In addition to the default categories there has also been added Global (storing SCSS variables) and Utilities (storing general helper classes).

From http://smacss.com/book/categorizing:

"At the very core of SMACSS is categorization. By categorizing CSS rules, we begin to see patterns and can define better practices around each of these patterns."
There are five types of categories:
 * Base
 * Layout
 * Module
 * State
 * Theme

However with some modifications this is the categories for this project:
 * Global
 * Base
 * Layout
 * Utility
 * Module
 * State
 * Theme

GLOBAL
==========
Global is used to store SCSS variables (font-sizes, spacing, etc.) and overall document styles as the font-size for the HTML tag.

BASE
==========
Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element selectors but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors. Essentially, a base style says that wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this.
Layout rules divide the page into sections.

LAYOUTS
==========
Layouts hold one or more modules together.

MODULES
==========
Modules are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.

STATE
==========
State rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state. Is it hidden or expanded? Is it active or inactive? They are about describing how a module or layout looks on screens that are smaller or bigger. They are also about describing how a module might look in different views like the home page or the inside page.

THEME
==========
Finally, Theme rules are similar to state rules in that they describe how modules or layouts might look. Most sites don’t require a layer of theming but it is good to be aware of it."
